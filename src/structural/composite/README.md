# TL;DR

A system in which an element and a group of those elements follow the same interface.
This allows the client code to not worry about quantities and pushes relevant logic inside the elements.

# Usefulness

- Abstract tree structure complexity away from the client code.
- Internal arrangements of the composite are hidden from the client code.
